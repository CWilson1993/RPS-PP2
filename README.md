# Rock, Paper, Scissors

This was a project to create a game for someone to just enjoy or help them decide something. The game is something most people would have experienced as kids but online.

## Features

### Exisiting Features
* #### Chosen Area
    * This is the first section on the page. 
    * It is blank at first but it is clear what the information is about.
    * Once the user makes their choice the computer makes a random choice and the result will populate.

* #### Choice Area
    * This section is simple but the idea is to have clear hand images to represent the choices.
    * The user clicks the button of their choice which will start the game.
    * The chosen button changes colour so that the user knows which one has been picked.

* #### Score Area
    * This section keeps track of who wins each round.
    * I wrote a JavaScript function which increments the score for whoever wins. If it is a draw then nothing changes.
    * The font colour of the scores is different so as to draw a clear distinction between who wins.

* #### About Section
    * This section is just a little information for people who may have never played before.
    * It gives a brief idea of what the game can be used for and what the rules are.

* ### Features For Future Version
    * I would like to add two more game types, one where the user choice is random and the other would allow two users to play.
    * I will implement sounds for when a user wins or loses.
